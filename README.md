# svxlink_to_rpitx
This repository will have the code to use rtl_sdr dongle vir reception and rpitx as transmitter.
I got insperation from the code devloped here http://www.pg540.org/wiki/index.php/RPITX_interface_to_SVXlink_using_GNUradio
# Description
This project will run on a raspberry Pi and use rpitx Transmitter board from Giga Technology for TX and rtl_sdr dongle for reseption.<br>
Gnuradio will be used to interface between svxlink and rpitx and from rtl_sdr and svxlink<br>
Functional Description : The receiver side is all handled by allready existing functionality in SVXLink using Ddr receiver.<br> All configuration is well documented in svxlink.conf. The transmitter part interface is made out of 3 components.<br> The audio coming from SVXlink TX1 is routed via UDP port 1235 to GNUradio, the PTT is routed to PseudoTTY port /home/pi/ptt and the TCP output port 8011 of GNUradio IQ stream is routed to RPITX.<br> When SVXlink wants to transmit it sends a charackter T to the PseudoTTY device ( PTT ON ), a perl script which is started after the start of SVXlink will monitor this PseudoTTY and once it will see the character T it will execute other script starting first RPITX snd then Python GNUradio script.<br> This will switch on the transmitter and audio is routed to RPITX. When SVXlink need to stop transmitting then the character R is send by SVXlink to the PseudoTTY and received by the script monitoring the PTY. It will kill RPITX and Python GNUradio script.<br> As it takes a bit of time to start RPITX ( initializing the PLL ) and starting the TCP listener and starting Python some extra delay is given to SVXLink in the configuration.<br>
The script stop_gnuradio_ptt.py and start_gnuradio_ptt.py id sending a xmlrpc message to gnuradio to stop or start the tx rf signal that get send to rpitx<br>
# Dependinsies
1) rpitx<br>
2) rtl_sdr<br>
3) svxlink<br>
4) gnuradio<br>
# Usage
copy all repository files in the root pi directory.<br>
copy the svxlink.conf to the /etc/svxlink/ directory<br>
run the following scripts in the pi directory.<br>
sudo ./start_tx.sh<br>
sudo ./start_tx.sh<br>
Set the rx frequency in the svxlink.conf file.<br>
Set the tx frequency in the start_echo_test.sh script<br>
Set the Vox level in the svxlink.conf<br>
set the echolink audio level in the svxlink.conf<br>

# Project Status
Working SVX link system.

# SVX Configuration

SVXlink configuration changes are :<br>
The svxlink.conf in this repository has already have this config
In [RX1] of svxlink.conf configure TYPE=Ddr, SIGLEV_DET=DDR, SIGLEV_DET=2.61, SIGLEV_OFFSET=150, FQ=433540000, WBRX=WbRX1<br>
<br>
In [WbRX1] put TYPE=RtlUSB, DEV_MATCH=0, HOST=localhost, PORT=1234, CENTER_FQ=433540000, GAIN=3.7,PEAK_METER=1, SAMPLE_RATE=960000<br>

In [TX1] put TYPE=LOCAL, AUDIO_DEV=udp:127.0.0.1:1235, AUDO_CHANNEL=0, PTT_TYPE=PTY, PTT_PTY=/home/pi/ptt.pl<br>
